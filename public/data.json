    "blogDescription":"React is a JavaScript library for creating user interfaces. First up, note that React is a library and not a framework, though it's often referred to as one. This is because it doesn't create any sort of 'scaffold' for the project. That means that this library alone is generally not enough to complete a project. Indeed, React developers often create apps using extra tools like Redux, TypeScript, and Jest. Instead, React just performs one task: it displays interface components synchronized with the application's data.Soon after the advent of React, similar options like Vue.js and Svelte essentially took over the front-end world. The common denominator here is that they all help solve problems based on a declarative approach rather than an imperative approach. Here's how those two approaches break down: Declarative approach: describes the end result. Basically, the result we want to have.Imperative approach: describes the specific steps to achieve an end result. That is, the steps we must take to get a result. As it turns out, the declarative approach is great for creating interfaces, and this has taken root in the tech community. Furthermore, this approach doesn't solely apply to web technologies. For instance, Apple has recently introduced the SwiftUI framework based on the same principles.To better understand the difference between the two approaches, let's take a look at them in more detail. We'll create two versions of a simple application. One with HTML and JS (using an imperative approach) and the other with React (applying the declarative approach). Our application will display a number and a button which will increase the value of the number by one each time it is clicked.",

    "blogDescription":"Programming is one of the most amazing and evergreen fields of recent times. The way the pandemic has affected all the businesses, it’s the need of the hour to Go Digital! Meaning, if you want your business to survive, you will now surely need to take it online. The way businesses used to operate over the years is about to change completely and thus, your business will need to make a way for programming to survive and to reach the audience.If you think How? Then here’s an example, If you are a tutor and have been teaching offline in your coaching centers for years, that’s amazing! But, will it survive in the coming future? Of Course not! Thus, you might need to go online and take your courses online. Maybe live sessions or sell pre-recorded sessions. Point is, you will need to go digital! And here is where you will need a platform, maybe a third party or your own to sell your courses, and here is where Programming comes in. You will need a web application or a mobile application, and thus, you can’t avoid programming.Similarly, if you run a hotel business, or maybe a toy shop, you will need to make space for programming.So here’s why avoiding programming can be bad for your business, As we have already discussed, programming is the future since the world is getting more tech-savvy and technologies are ruling. Technology is embedded everywhere and there is no doubt that it has become a part of our daily life whether it’s entertainment or we have to communicate with someone or we have to go somewhere. We are relying on technologies and there are thousands of industries dependent on computer programs to run their business operations. And due to digitalization, the demand is ever-increasing and the need of the hour. Programming is always considered as all about something computational, mathematical, frustrating, and boring but there is a creative side of it as well. When programmers see something is imperfect in this world then it becomes their job to analyze the problem and to give a visionary solution. Just like painters, a clever programmer picks a suitable programming language, design patterns, patterns of logical expression to implement the solution. Isn’t that what we call business? To be creative and come up with something that would solve a world problem?In any kind of industry or business, it always becomes difficult for a non-programmer or departments who have to do nothing with coding to understand the complete process that requires to get the job done. A misunderstanding is always developed between engineers and non-programmers when it comes to finding a solution for a specific problem. So, to run the operations smoothly and come up with greater good, avoiding programming will be bad for your business. Programming always gives you a new challenge where you have to take the risk every time and that teaches you to take the risk in your life too. The world is full of software, apps, websites and when you build these things on your own you feel more confident and powerful. When a programmer is able to solve a problem that had no solution before it becomes a life-changing experience for them. And that is what business is all about, right? Challenges, Risk, and Solution.",

    "blogDescription":"The React team and community has long placed a deserved emphasis on developer experience: ensuring that React has good error messages, focusing on components as a way to reason locally about app behavior, crafting APIs that are predictable and encourage correct usage by design, etc. But we haven’t provided enough guidance on the best ways to achieve a great user experience in large apps.For example, the React team has focused on framework performance and providing tools for developers to debug and tune application performance (e.g. React.memo). But we haven’t been as opinionated about the high-level patterns that make the difference between fast, fluid apps and slow, janky ones. We always want to ensure that React remains approachable to new users and supports a variety of use-cases — not every app has to be “blazing” fast. But as a community we can and should aim high. We should make it as easy as possible to build apps that start fast and stay fast, even as they grow in complexity, for users on varying devices and networks around the world.Concurrent Mode and Suspense are experimental features that can help developers achieve this goal. We first introduced them at JSConf Iceland in 2018, intentionally sharing details very early to give the community time to digest the new concepts and to set the stage for subsequent changes. Since then we’ve completed related work, such as the new Context API and the introduction of Hooks, which are designed in part to help developers naturally write code that is more compatible with Concurrent Mode. But we didn’t want to implement these features and release them without validating that they work. So over the past year, the React, Relay, web infrastructure, and product teams at Facebook have all collaborated closely to build a new version of facebook.com that deeply integrates Concurrent Mode and Suspense to create an experience with a more fluid and app-like feel.Thanks to this project, we’re more confident than ever that Concurrent Mode and Suspense can make it easier to deliver great, fast user experiences. But doing so requires rethinking how we approach loading code and data for our apps. Effectively all of the data-fetching on the new facebook.com is powered by Relay Hooks — new Hooks-based Relay APIs that integrate with Concurrent Mode and Suspense out of the box.",
